  Bis (Hexamethylene Triamine Penta (Methylene Phosphonic acid)


  BHMT phosphonate is highly effective scale inhibitor developed for use in controlling carbonate and sulfate salt precipitates. BHMT has advantages over conventional phosphonates due to its high thermal stability (at up to 120 ºC) and high calcium tolerance for a wide range of pH. It is for this reason, BHMT phos can be incorporated in oilfield water chemistries where high brine system stability is needed.
